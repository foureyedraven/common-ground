    <p>
Children are naturally curious and teach themselves what theyâ€™re inspired by. Common Ground believes that creating engaging and simple material will inspire children to love and learn math, science and language. 
Common Ground is also built on the belief that all students deserve high quality, engaging education that is free and supported by their community. The goal is to have every student on common ground, with equal opportunity to grow.
